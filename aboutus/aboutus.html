            <h2>WHY WE STARTED!</h2> 
            <br>
                <p>To develop an online auction system which will provide a forum for sellers to interact with buyers and sell items to interested bidders. Away from the noisy crowds like conventional system where users have to sit for hours and bid. And wait for the immidiate declaration of the winner. Alot of time to think before making the bid.Here bidder’s can bid any time and from anywhere.</p>
